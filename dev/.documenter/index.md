- **Distance Functions**: Various distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan, Chebyshev)
  
- **Metric Balls**: Efficient neighborhood queries
  
- **Sampling Methods**: Îµ-nets, farthest point sampling, random sampling
  
- **Datasets**: Built-in geometric datasets (spheres, tori, cubes)
  
- **Analysis Tools**: Neighborhood analysis, filtering, and nerve computations
  

## Installation {#Installation}

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("MetricSpaces")
```


## Quick Start {#Quick-Start}

```julia
using MetricSpaces

# Create a metric space from 2D points
points = [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0], [5.0, 6.0], [1.1, 2.1]]
X = EuclideanSpace(points)

# Find points within distance 1.0 of the first point
center = X[1]
nearby_indices = ball_ids(X, center, 1.0)

# Compute pairwise distances
distances = pairwise_distance(X)

# Generate an Îµ-net covering
landmarks = epsilon_net(X, 2.0)
```
