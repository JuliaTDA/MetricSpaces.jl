# Mathematical Background

This section provides the mathematical foundation for understanding metric spaces and the concepts implemented in MetricSpaces.jl.

## Metric Spaces

A **metric space** is a fundamental concept in mathematics that formalizes the notion of distance between elements in a set.

### Definition

A metric space is a pair $(X, d)$ where:
- $X$ is a non-empty set (called the **underlying set**)
- $d: X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ is a function (called the **metric** or **distance function**)

The metric $d$ must satisfy the following axioms for all $x, y, z \in X$:

1. **Non-negativity**: $d(x, y) \geq 0$
2. **Identity of indiscernibles**: $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$
3. **Symmetry**: $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
4. **Triangle inequality**: $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$

### Common Distance Functions

#### Euclidean Distance
For points $x, y \in \mathbb{R}^n$:
```math
d_2(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2}
```

#### Manhattan Distance (L¹ norm)
```math
d_1(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|
```

#### Chebyshev Distance (L∞ norm)
```math
d_\infty(x, y) = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} |x_i - y_i|
```

## Metric Balls

### Open Balls
Given a metric space $(X, d)$, a point $x \in X$, and a radius $r > 0$, the **open ball** centered at $x$ with radius $r$ is:
```math
B(x, r) = \{y \in X : d(x, y) < r\}
```

### Closed Balls
The **closed ball** is defined as:
```math
\overline{B}(x, r) = \{y \in X : d(x, y) \leq r\}
```

### Properties
- Open balls are the basis for the topology of metric spaces
- Every point in a metric space has a neighborhood system given by open balls
- Balls can be empty, finite, or infinite depending on the underlying space

## Covering Theory

### ε-nets
An **ε-net** for a metric space $(X, d)$ is a subset $L \subseteq X$ such that:
```math
X \subseteq \bigcup_{x \in L} B(x, \varepsilon)
```

In other words, every point in $X$ is within distance $ε$ of some point in $L$.

#### Properties of ε-nets:
- **Covering property**: Every point is covered by at least one ε-ball
- **Efficiency**: ε-nets provide sparse representations of dense point sets
- **Approximation**: ε-nets preserve geometric properties up to scale ε

### Farthest Point Sampling
Farthest point sampling is a greedy algorithm that constructs a sequence of points where each new point is as far as possible from all previously selected points.

**Algorithm**:
1. Start with an arbitrary point $x_1 \in X$
2. For $k = 2, 3, \ldots$, choose $x_k$ such that:
   ```math
   x_k = \arg\max_{x \in X} \min_{1 \leq i \leq k-1} d(x, x_i)
   ```

This method produces well-separated point sets that are useful for:
- Geometric approximation
- Landmark selection
- Sparse representations

## Neighborhoods and Local Structure

### k-Neighborhoods
For a point $x \in X$, the **k-neighborhood** consists of the $k$ nearest points to $x$:
```math
N_k(x) = \{y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_k\}
```
where $d(x, y_1) \leq d(x, y_2) \leq \cdots \leq d(x, y_k)$ and $y_i \neq x$.

### Local Density and Filtering
The **distance to measure** for a point $x$ with respect to a measure $\mu$ and parameter $m$ is:
```math
d_{\mu,m}(x) = \inf\{r > 0 : \mu(B(x, r)) \geq m\}
```

This concept is used in:
- Outlier detection
- Density-based clustering
- Topological data analysis

## Applications in Topological Data Analysis

### Nerve Complexes
Given a covering $\mathcal{U} = \{U_\alpha\}$ of a space $X$, the **nerve** is a simplicial complex where:
- Vertices correspond to sets in the covering
- A $k$-simplex is formed by $(k+1)$ sets with non-empty intersection

### Persistent Homology
Metric spaces provide the foundation for persistent homology by:
- Defining filtrations through distance-based constructions
- Creating Vietoris-Rips complexes from metric data
- Analyzing topological features across scales

## Implementation Notes

MetricSpaces.jl implements these concepts with:
- **Efficient data structures** for large-scale metric spaces
- **Optimized algorithms** for common operations
- **Flexible distance functions** supporting custom metrics
- **Progress tracking** for long-running computations

The package is designed to handle both theoretical exploration and practical applications in data analysis and computational topology.
