A type to model metric spaces where each element is an array of the same length.

"""
    EuclideanSpace(X::Vector{T}) where {T}

Constructs a `EuclideanSpace` object from a vector of vectors `X`, ensuring all inner vectors have the same length.

# Arguments
- `X::Vector{T}`: A vector of vectors, where each inner vector represents a point in Euclidean space.

# Returns
- `EuclideanSpace{N, T2}`: An instance of `EuclideanSpace` with dimension `N` (the length of the inner vectors) and element type `T2`.

# Throws
- An error if the inner vectors of `X` do not all have the same length.

# Notes
- Converts the input vectors to `SVector`s for internal consistency, then back to regular vectors for compatibility.

    EuclideanSpace(M::Matrix{T}) where {T}

Constructs a `EuclideanSpace` object from a matrix `M` of type `Matrix{T}`. Each column of the matrix `M` is interpreted as a point in the Euclidean space, and the resulting space is constructed from the collection of these points.

# Arguments
- `M::Matrix{T}`: A matrix where each column represents a point in the Euclidean space.

# Returns
- A `EuclideanSpace` object containing the points represented by the columns of `M`.
